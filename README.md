# Day Planner Challenge 

## Description of Project
An employee with a busy schedule wants to be able to add important events to a daily planner so that she can manage her time effectively.

## Aims/Goals

The employee is using a daily planner to create a schedule.

1. When the employee opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. As the employee scrolls down, she is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
3. When the employee views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. When the employee clicks into a time block, she can enter an event.
5. When the employee clicks the save button for that time block the text for that event is saved in local storage.
6. When the employee refreshes the page, the saved events persist.
